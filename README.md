## Project Scenario
The team at Apollonia Dental Practice is trying to set the foundations to digitalize their employee management. In time, they'll want to be able to have digital records of their employees and departments, assign patients to each member of their medical staff, assign projects to each staff member, and more. To do this, they want to begin creating a basic CRUD web app, storing and managing information about their employees and departments, as a foundation to further develop the app upon in the future. They want you to develop a database and web app reflecting their current organization, staff members and departments. The team will use your development to begin creating a new digital employee management system in order to better manage their dental practice and its workforce. 

## Project objectives
- Create a database with employees and departments
- Create a web UI for employees and departments management
- Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the employees and departments database using the web UI

## Challenges

My task will be to create a fundamental employee management CRUD web app to store information about employees and departments, and perform CRUD operations on the employee data, using Node.js and MongoDB. To do this, I will create a Node.js server and MongoDB database, create employees and departments collections, write a UI in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and let users perform CRUD operations on the database via a REST API through the web UI.

In this project, I'll use organizational data from the Apollonia Dental Practice, and the following technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, ExpressJS, MongoDB, REST API.

After I perform my development, I will share my outcome, packaging it with Docker.
